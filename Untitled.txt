About:
some errors showing on top of the page


SLOT: Add new fields starton, endon in the database and form also. This will show/hide the slots on front end as per the dates provided.
HideOnDates-We may need to create another table like slotdetails table to keep dates on which the slot needs to be disabled. Fields can be seq, slotseq, date.
MENU: Currently we have flat prices of the menu. Now we need to add another feature to provide specific pricing for selected dates. We will create new table as menupricing with fields as seq, menuseq, date, price, description. While creating the menu in admin area. We can let admin select multiple dates and set price and description on it. Try using chosen like control with calendar control.
BOOKING AVAILABLE TILL: We need to keep another field on slots table with bookingavailabletill. This field will just have a time value to show/hide the slot till that time of the day. Like if we entered value as 3PM. It means that the slot will show only till 3PM of that day. After that time it will not display it as available.
ZOHO: Zoho forms integration. API to be provided by client. We need to send fields list of booking to the client.

ROLES & PERMISSIONS: with combination of locations.
LOCATIONS: This will let admin add multiple locations of the dining. Currently we have Bangalore, this will let them add any number of locations and the admin area will work within the selected location's prospect.
TIME NOT SHOWING (BUG): Chrome does not shows timing in the admin booking grid.
EMAIL FIELD: Admin bookings to display email id also.
BOOK My SHOW : UI to be copied from there.
ADDONS: We need to create another feature to let admin add "addons" like cake, photographs, flowers etc. It may have seq, addon, price, description etc.
EXPORT TO EXCEL: Export bookings data as per selected from, to dates (booking date)
RESCHEDULING: Booking to be rescheduled without user login. Maybe with OTP or something.
